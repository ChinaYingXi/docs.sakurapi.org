# Basic Introduction

Sakura Pi RK3308B is our first officially released SBC, a low-power, low-cost development board based on the Rockchip RK3308B SoC.

### Processor

Thanks to the ARMÂ® Cortex A35 processor, the RK3308B has many advantages such as low power consumption, low cost, and low heat generation.
In modern mobile device processor architectures, the Cortex A35 often plays the role of a "little core" (efficiency core/E-core) due to its high efficiency, helping systems achieve a good balance between handling complex tasks and long standby times.
